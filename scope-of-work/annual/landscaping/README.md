# Note on the Mow Map

The mow map has been developed through an examination of property lines depicted on the plat, combined with an understanding of areas that are irrigated versus those that are not.

It has been identified that there is a discrepancy in the plat concerning the property lines of homes situated at the entrances of Graford Lane, San Saba Lane, and Haywire Lane. 
The plat inaccurately portrays the sidewalks along these entrances as part of the homeowners' property. However, certified surveys obtained from the homeowners indicate that their 
property lines terminate before reaching the sidewalk, consistent with the situation at the entrances of Presidio Lane, Kerrville Lane, and Armstrong Ranch Drive.
